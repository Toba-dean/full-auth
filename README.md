# A full fledged authentication api.

## ðŸ“£ Summary
This api is built using ExpressJS and MongoDB for storing the users. It uses express-fileupload to upload photo to cloudinary, it also uses the google api, google OAuth2 and nodemailer to send authorization mails to newly registered users so as to verify their registration before being stored in the database. The jsonwebtoken is used to generate three different tokens, the activation token sent to the users email for verification, the refresh token which is generated on login and an access token which is used to access the users profile, change password, reset password.
